## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens which represent securities on-chain.

## Abstract

Whilst this standard is not directly backwards compatible with ERC20, it is trivial to provide implementations to make it so (see `ERC20Adaptor.sol`).

### Token Metadata

Standard provides a flexible way to attach a set of named external assets to the token.

This is done through the `details` mapping from the asset name, to it's external URL. For example bytes32('legend') could map to a URL detailing the general transfer restrictions on this security (i.e. the share certificate legend).

### Individual Token Metadata

Tokens that represent securities often require metadata to be attached to individual tokens.

This metadata groups tokens into sets of tokens where each token in a set shares common metadata.

Metadata is represented by a `bytes32 tranche`, which can be further linked to additional data as any implementation requires.

Token fungibility includes metadata so we have:
  - tokens within a given token sets are fungible
  - tokens from different token sets may not be fungible

### Transfer Restrictions

Transfer restrictions are assessed at the (sender, receiver, tranche, amount, approval) granularity.

To provide additional transparency over the reasons why a transfer may fail, `verifyTransfer` is used.

The `bytes _approval` provides an optional mechanism for an authorised person to provide a one-off approval (which can be interpreted and validated inside `verifyTransfer`). This provides an off-chain approval model to complement any on-chain enforced rules. `_approval` can be empty if not required for a particular transaction.

`transferTranche` / `transferTrancheFrom` must respect the outcome of `verifyTransfer`.

TODO: Consider whether `bool _isTransfer` should be a parameter to `verifyTransfer`.

Since such tokens represent ownership in real off-chain assets, there should also be more clarity in terms of how and when such tokens can be created. ERC20 does not provide any specification around the way in which tokens are created, concerning itself only with how such tokens are then subsequently transferred.

## Motivation

A standard interface for tokens that represent securitised assets allows such tokens to be consistently managed by third parties including exchanges, wallets and custodial services.

For tokens representing securitised assets, having clarity around a single standard for managing transfer restrictions and token creation will help drive reasonable and clear regulation in this area.

### Methods

verifyTransfer

`function verifyTransfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) public view returns (bool success);`

Returns either true or false, indicating whether the transfer of `_amount` tokens from `_from` to `_to` would succeed.

`verifyTransfer` should not throw for any valid arguments, but always return either `true` or `false`.

Any call to `transfer` or `transferFrom` should respect the result of `verifyTransfer`. So if `verifyTransfer` returns false for a given set of arguments, then a call made to `transfer` or `transferFrom`, in the same transaction, with no intermediary state changes in the token or associated contracts should fail (either by returning false, or throwing). Correspondingly if `verifyTransfer` returns true, then with the same conditions, `transfer` and `transferFrom` should succeed.

Note - if a call to `verifyTransfer` is executed, and the corresponding call to `transfer` or `transferFrom` is then executed in a subsequent transaction (or token state is modified between the call to `verifyTransfer` and `transfer` or `transferFrom`) then there are no guarantees on the behaviour of `transfer` or `transferFrom`.

mint

`function mint(address _investor, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool success);`

Returns either true or false, indicating whether or not the creation of `_amount` tokens and allocation of these tokens to `_investor` succeeded or failed. Callers must check the return value, and not assume that this function will throw on failure.

Any increase to the tokens `totalSupply` must happen through a call to `mint`. This includes any initialisation of the `totalSupply` value.

A successful execution of this function should emit a corresponding `Minted` event representing the number of tokens created, and the address to which these tokens have been allocated.

burn

`function burn(address _investor, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool success);`

Returns either true or false, indicating whether or not the destruction of `_amount` tokens held by `_investor` succeeded or failed. Callers must check the return value, and not assume that this function will throw on failure.

Any decrease to the tokens `totalSupply` must happen through a call to `burn`.

Note - tokens can still effectively be burnt outside of this function by transferring them to an unreachable address (e.g. 0x0) but this would not reduce the official `totalSupply`.

A successful execution of this function should emit a corresponding `Burnt` event representing the number of tokens destroyed, and the address from which these tokens were taken.

## Rationale

This standard solves some of the problems of ERC20 tokens with respect to representing securitised assets on the Ethereum blockchain. By providing a standard that all security tokens can easily conform to, development of associated services and platforms (e.g. exchanges, wallets, custodial, identity) can easily and uniformly deal with such tokens.

By insisting that such tokens are registered via ERC820, third parties can easily check on-chain whether a token implements these additional functions on top of ERC20 and use them appropriately.

The tokenisation of securities on the blockchain is a major use-case and natural progression from the more general ERC20 and associated token standards.

As an example, an exchange wishing to determine whether or not to allow Adam to purchase 100 SEC tokens from Bob could check on-chain the results of:  
```
verifyTransfer(bob_address, adam_address, 100)
verifyTransfer(exchange_address, adam_address, 100)
```
before adjusting its internal ledger (which may not involve any actual call to `transfer` or `transferFrom`) to reflect the trade.

As a further example, any regulator / auditor can review the conditions under which `mint` can be called, and ensure that the creating of tokens is valid under security regulations.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERCxxx is a super-set of ERC20 and as such is entirely backwards compatible with the ERC20 standard. Any token implementing ERCxxx must also implement the full ERC20 standard.
