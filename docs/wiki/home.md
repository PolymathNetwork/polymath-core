# Welcome to the Polymath Core Wiki

Before running the CLI and testing out the contracts from the perspective of the issuer/investor, please make sure to reference and understand [How Polymath Works](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/README.md)

## Polymath: Walking through the CLI

The Polymath CLI allows for users \(investors/issuers\) to walk themselves through all the details and processes of an STO.

You can easily navigate through it with the sidebar directory in order to run the CLI and set up and test the following:
