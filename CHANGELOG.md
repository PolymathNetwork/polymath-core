# v1.3.0  

[__1.3.0__](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymath-core?activeTab=readme) __25-07-18__

## Added
* Implemented `finishedIssuerMinting / finishedSTOMinting`. The former permanently forbids the issuer from minting tokens. The latter permanently forbids STO modules from minting tokens.     
* Added registry of registries. Contracts should point to the registry which acts as a proxy and delegates to the corresponding registry contract.
* Added ModifyWhitelistMulti to Percentage Transfer Manager.    
* Add the `Transfer` event in the getTokens function call of `PolyTokenFaucet.sol`.     
* Introduce the `_valid` flag in the event of `LogModifyWhitelist` in `PercentageTransferManager.sol`

## Changed
* Removed _locked parameter from modules. This was only used on STOs to allow the issuer to indicate they would not be minting more tokens after the STO (since it wouldn't be possible to remove it), but now we have the finishedSTOMinting flag that they can use to indicate so in a more transparent way.

# v1.2.1

[__1.2.1__](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymath-core?activeTab=readme) __27-06-18__

## Added
* Further minting can be forbids on the Issuer level and the STO level using the functions `finishMintingIssuer()`,`finishMintingSTO()`.
* `modifyWhitelistMulti` added in `PercentageTransferManager` contract.    

##Changed
* Added extra parameter to TransferManager.verifyTransfer to indicate whether the call is part of a transfer or not.  

## Removed
* Logic of module locking is removed and also removes the `_locked` parameter.    
* Remove `finishMinting()` function from the `SecurityToken` contract.


# v1.2.0

[__1.2.0__](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymath-core?activeTab=readme) __22-05-18__

## Added

* ERC20DividendCheckpoint module added for on-chain dividend ERC20 payments
* EtherDividendCheckpoint module added for on-chain dividend ETH payments
* Iterable list of investors available on-chain

* ManualApprovalTransferManager - allows approval or blocking of explicit address pairs for transfers.
* Module Factories now allow their owner to set 3 types of fees: Setup fee, Usage fee, Monthly fee.
* Added Checkpoint feature to token. This allows the issuer to create snapshots of the token's balances and totalSupply to be used for casting votes or distributing dividends. Created CLI to demo this feature.
* Further minting is forbidden by adding one additional check for `mintingFinished` flag. Issuer can stop minting by calling the `finishMinting()` function.
* Issuer can prevent addresses from participating in the STO. To facilitate this, `_canBuyFromSTO` has been added to modifyWhitelist function.
* Added multi-mint feature.
* Event `LogGenerateModuleFromFactory` emitted at the level of ModuleFactory to log the creation of the module using the respective module factory.
* Added registration fee of `250 POLY` for registering ticker or security token with registry contracts, fee can be changed using `changePolyRegistrationFee`.
* Added ReclaimTokens contract to handle retrieving ERC20 Tokens sent to our contracts.
* Added Pausable feature to registry functions `registerTicker`, `generateSecurityToken`, `registerModule`, `addCustomSecurityToken`.
* Added Registry contract to handle upgradability functionality with a function to change the reference address between registry contracts.
* POLY faucet CLI is added in demo.  
* `getDividendIndex()` is introduced in `ERC20DividendCheckpoint` & `EtherDividendCheckpoint` contract.

## Changed

* Added extra parameter to TransferManager.verifyTransfer to indicate whether the call is part of a transfer or not.  
* Added a new return type to verifyTransfer methods called FORCE_VALID which would override any INVALID returned by TransferManagers if needed. For example, this could be used if we wanted the Manual Approval TM to force a transfer to happen even if the CountTM said that the 2000 investor cap had been reached.
* Burning tokens now respects TransferManagers and investorCount.  
* Updated CLI with MultiMint process.  
* Change the `setupCost` of `cappedSTOFactory` from `0 POLY` to `20K POLY`.

* added CountTransferManager to restrict the total number of token holders
* added PercentageTransferManager to restrict the total percentage of tokens held by any single holder
* generateSecurityToken in SecurityTokenRegistry takes an additional parameter specifying whether the token is divisible.
* IModule contract takes the polyToken contract address as the constructor argument to wrapping all the factories with the polyToken contract address.      
* `takeFee()` new function introduced to extract the POLY token from the factory. It only be called by the owner of the factory.      
* Added ability for issuer to provide a signed piece of data to allow investors to whitelist themselves.
* `_securityTokenAddress` get indexed in the `LogNewSecurityToken` event.     
* Now each investor have its `expiryTime` for the KYC. After the expiryTime limit reached, investor will not abe to use transfer related functions.
* Transfers of tokens gets paused at the level of all TM as well as on the ST level. To facilitate this 3 functions get added namely
`pause()`, `unpause()`,`freezeTransfers()`. All 3 functions are called by the issuer of the securityToken only.
* Security token has got a new feature of burning the tokens, To use this feature user need to call the `burn()` function but before that issuer need to deploy the `TokenBurner` contract and set its address into the SecurityToken contract using the function `setTokenBurner()`.            

## Remove

`permissionManagerFactory`.   
* New Module type is added called `PermissionManager`. It has three contracts called GeneralPermissionManagerFactory, GeneralPermissionManager, IPermissionManager.
* `GeneralPermissionManger` is all about providing the permission to the delegate corresponds to the SecurityToken. Major functionality is added, check, change the permission of the delegate.

* `SafeMath.sol` contract is replaced by the zeppelin-solidity library contract .  
*  No more `SecurityTokens` and `symbol` information will be directly part of the SecurityTokenRegistry. Those information will accessed by inheriting the `ISecurityTokenRegistry`.   
* Remove the Delegable.sol, AclHelpers.sol, DelegablePorting.sol contracts. Now permission manager factory takes their place . * `delegates` mapping removed from the GeneralTransferManager.
