Token Symbol Registration

Registering the new token symbol requires 250 POLY & deducted from '0x02d502D968d3dBa68A9Db31B656fb0201dD0151f', Current balance is 1100500 POLY
```

**NOTE: You must have POLY to go through this section. If you havenâ€™t already done so, scroll up to the** [**FAUCET instructions**](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/wiki/How-to-Use-the-POLY-Faucet) **and get funded!**
